# Hello-world
Just another repository
I'm cofused about my future. Whether I should be a programming coder or continue to do my design work. To my embrass, I sign up a dispatch contract with the company where I am working. I think myself to be a confident man. But when I lose my first job. I spent nearly two months finding the job. Maybe learning to knowing myself is the most important target that I should achieve in the nearly two years.
